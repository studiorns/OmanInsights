                <ul>
                    <li>The 0.38 elasticity means that for every 10% increase in media impressions, travel queries increase by approximately 3.8%.</li>
                    <li>This indicates that media investments drive travel queries with moderate efficiency.</li>
                    <li>The relationship is positive and solidly in the moderate range (above 0.3).</li>
                    <li>Media campaigns will generate positive ROI but with moderate efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Doubling media spend will not double travel queries, but will produce modest growth.</li>
                    <li>The moderate elasticity suggests that the Oman market is somewhat responsive to media campaigns, but other factors also significantly influence travel decisions.</li>
                    <li>This moderate responsiveness suggests that media investments should be complemented by other marketing approaches, such as addressing specific barriers to visitation, particularly expense concerns (48%).</li>

                <h5>Strategic Example:</h5>
                <p>If you're planning to increase media impressions by 20% for a campaign targeting the Oman market, you can expect approximately a 7.6% increase in travel queries (20% × 0.38 = 7.6%). This helps set realistic expectations for campaign performance and ROI calculations.</p>

                    <li><strong>Preference for Other Destinations</strong>: 38% (+5pp) would rather visit other places</li>

                <h5>Business Implications:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Expense Concerns (48%, +6pp)</strong>: This significant increase indicates growing price sensitivity in the Oman market. Marketing should emphasize value for money and consider developing more affordable package options specifically for this market.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preference for Other Destinations (38%, +5pp)</strong>: This increase suggests growing competition from alternative destinations. Marketing should emphasize Abu Dhabi's unique selling points and differentiation from competing destinations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Age Perception (35%, +2pp)</strong>: The perception that Abu Dhabi is "only for older people" is a significant barrier, particularly for a market that shows strong interest in theme parks and entertainment. Marketing should highlight the family-friendly and youth-oriented attractions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Knowledge (35%, +7pp)</strong>: This substantial increase suggests a need for more educational marketing content about Abu Dhabi's offerings. Awareness is high (91.37%), but specific knowledge about attractions and experiences may be lacking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Previous Visitation (33%, -1pp)</strong>: The slight decrease suggests that repeat visitation is becoming less of a barrier. Marketing should continue to highlight new attractions and experiences to encourage return visits.</li>
                    <li>The combination of expense concerns and preference for other destinations suggests a value perception issue that needs to be addressed through targeted marketing.</li>

                <p>Develop a "Value Discovery" campaign specifically for the Oman market that highlights affordable package options bundling accommodation with theme park tickets. Focus on showcasing the entertainment options that appeal to younger travelers to counter the age perception barrier. Include educational content about the variety of experiences available to address the knowledge gap. Emphasize new attractions and experiences to encourage those who have previously visited to return.</p>
